### *Build 3 instances t2.micro on amazon linux, controller, host-manager-1 and host-manager-2*
- hostnamectl set-hostname controller
- bash
- ssh-keygen
- ip a s
- cd .ssh
- vim authorized_keys
- cat id_rsa.pub
  
#### *Here incase of controller copy paste the public key of other two instances and paste the keys in the vim file and likewise do the same for other 2 instances to establish connection*

### *Controller*
- systemctl start sshd 
- systemctl enable sshd

#### *Use ping command to check if the connection is established between the instances and allow ICMP port in network security*

### *Controller -   Install ansible*

- yum install ansible* -y
- ansible --version
- cd /etc/ansible/
- vim ansible.cfg

### *Paste the below content inside the vim file*

# deeply nested home directories) this can exceed the character limit on
# file socket names (108 characters for most platforms). In that case, you 
# may wish to shorten the string below.
# 
# Example: 
# control_path = %(directory)s/%%h-%%r
#control_path = %(directory)s/ansible-ssh-%%h-%%p-%%r

# Enabling pipelining reduces the number of SSH operations required to 
# execute a module on the remote server. This can result in a significant 
# performance improvement when enabled, however when using "sudo:" you must 
# first disable 'requiretty' in /etc/sudoers
#
# By default, this option is disabled to preserve compatibility with
# sudoers configurations that have requiretty (the default on many distros).
